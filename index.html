        Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. 
        So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The 
        restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large 
        and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. 
        Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. 
        Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible

        It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to understand the stories 
        of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It is a 
        historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure 
        time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 
        for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the 
        accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.

        I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, 
        or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man 
        and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero 
        movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that 
        is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the 
        Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is 
        lengthy, and it does run for

        This is one the best Pirates movie out of the five released. High recommend watching this movie if you have 
        watched the previous two movies since the plot may be a little difficult to understand but this was basically 
        Endgame before Endgame. It brought a close to most of our character's story arcs and journeys. It had the right 
        amount of emotion and humor. The plot has really high stakes as the fate of all the pirates are at stake which 
        keeps you on the edge of your seat. The maelstrom battle is everything we could have hoped for with the Black 
        Pearl and the Flying Dutchman going head to head. Not to mention the beautiful score written by Hans Zimmer truly 
        make you feel the raw emotion of the story. Truly a spectacular work of art. "Not all treasure is silver and gold 
        mate." -Captain Jack Sparrow
        This movie is a treasure.

            'KGF:Chapter 1' set the tone for a slick gangster franchise-high on style and details. The first part was all 
            about establishing the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has 
            managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage 
            to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, 
            too.

                Couldn't have watched a better movie during the quarantined weekend. The overall presentation and 
                fictional storyline of the movie has been executed sooo perfectly. This is the fourth movie of Gerard 
                Butler that I watched, and he never leaves a reason to surprise the audience by his performance. 
                Altogether, it a best thriller for those who love to watch Army, Spy, Investigative series/movies. 
                I'd definitely recommend this movie to y'all.

          It's a charming movie, just like the first Boss Baby. However, it's a bit messy and might be more confusing 
          to keep up with for kids. The first Boss Baby gave me more feels and left me with more of a lasting impression
          than this one did but I would still recommend watching. The highlight of the Boss Baby series is the dynamic 
          between the brothers, but they do a good job of making the daughters likable characters as well. There are 
          some funny moments, it's not too long, and the animation is splendid! Just give it a watch, esp. if you've 
          seen the first film.
